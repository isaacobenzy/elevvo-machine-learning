## 📚 Student Final Score Predictor

A machine learning project that predicts a student's **final exam score** based on key factors like study hours, sleep, class participation, and previous scores. This project is part of a Level 1 Machine Learning internship task.

---

### 🚀 Features

* 📁 Upload and process any CSV file with relevant student data
* 📊 Automatically generates a correlation heatmap
* 📉 Trains a **Linear Regression** model to predict final scores
* ✅ Displays evaluation metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²)
* 🎛️ Interactive sliders to simulate custom student profiles and predict scores
* 📈 Visual comparison of actual vs. predicted scores

### 📂 Dataset

* **Name:** Student Performance Factors
* **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) (search: *Student Performance Factors*)
* **Format:** CSV

Required columns:

* `StudyHours`
* `SleepHours`
* `Participation`
* `PreviousScores`
* `FinalScore` (target)

---

### 💻 How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn plotly
```

2. Run the app:

```bash
streamlit run student_score_predictor.py
```

3. Upload your dataset in the sidebar and explore predictions!

### 📷 UI Preview

> *Optionally insert a screenshot of the app here if you're uploading to GitHub.*

---

### 🔍 Example Use Case

A school administrator or tutor can use this app to:

* Forecast student outcomes
* Understand key learning factors
* Plan interventions for low-performing students

---

### 🎯 Future Enhancements

* Add support for **Polynomial Regression**
* Allow for **feature selection**
* Export predicted results
* Add model comparison (e.g., Ridge vs. Lasso)
