## 🛍️ Mall Customer Segmentation App

A Streamlit-powered machine learning web app that performs **customer segmentation** using **K-Means clustering** and **DBSCAN**. Designed for visual exploration and business insight, this tool helps group mall customers based on features like **annual income** and **spending score**.

### 📦 Features

* 🔁 **Upload any compatible dataset** with customer features
* 🎛️ **Select numeric features** for clustering (2D projection)
* 📉 **Elbow method** to estimate the optimal number of clusters
* 🎨 **Interactive cluster visualization**
* 📋 **View average metrics per cluster**
* 🧪 **Bonus:** Try DBSCAN for density-based clustering
* 📥 **Export** clustered data to CSV
